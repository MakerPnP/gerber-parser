- [Docs (released)](https://docs.rs/gerber-parser/)

This crate implements a `gerber` parser written in rust to be used with the `gerber-types` crate.

## Example

See the `examples` folder of the repository, run it as follows:

    $ cargo run --example example1

## Spec compliance

The gerber specification 2024.05 is the latest version of the Gerber file format that is used for reference.

### Image Transformations

Image transformations have been deprecated since December 2012 (I1 revision).
The intention of these commands is not entirely clear when it comes to rendering, since the spec talks about
step and repeat distances not being coordinate data; However, it doesn't make any sense to have a command called
Mirror Image (MI) where the intention /appears/ to be to mirror the /entire/ image, which cannot be achieved unless you
also mirror step and repeat distances and apertures.  Thus it is advised for downstream crates to apply image
transformations to step and repeat distances and apertures when applying image transformations via (MI, SF, OF, IR).

The related crate 'gerber-viewer' (see below), creates an image transform matrix based on the image transformation
commands and applies them before rendering, but after primitive processing, resulting in a perfectly transformed image
which is always consistent.  However, depending on the intention of the author of the gerber file and the tools they were
using at the time that might not be "correct".  Thus, as per the spec, it's best to avoid these commands entirely to
avoid misinterpretation and/or manufacturing issues.

Refer to gerber spec 2024.05 sections 8.1.5 (IR), 8.1.7 (MI), 8.1.8 (OF), 8.1.9 (SF)
